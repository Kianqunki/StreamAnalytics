## Synopsis

It is well-known that most of corporations have very complex environment with many IT systems and IT services. Business continuity depends on keeping those systems and services up all the time. It also requires secure, reliable, and fast systems and services. Each system and service has its own pattern of activity. All those activities generate large log files every day. Monitoring and tracking the log messages are vital to provide secure, reliable and fast environment. The aim of this project is to develop an UX based application which will cluster log messages as soon as they occur and to detect anomalies in streaming log messages immediately to warn system administrators and services.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In a large environment the sheer volume of log files and events present issues and anomalies; many gigabytes of logs could be generated each day from one system alone, and thus manually reviewing log files is not only an inefficient method of review, it is also impractical. In addition, in a critical environment, some issues and anomalies must be detected whenever it happens to take immediate actions. Therefore, we would like to focus on this problem and develop a log file anomaly detector which work on streaming data. We anticipate that the application we will develop can be an alternative solution in the market against the problem.
